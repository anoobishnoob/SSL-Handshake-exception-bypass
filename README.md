# SSL-Handshake-exception-bypass

This code is to bypass a SSL Handshake if for whatever reason your program is suppossed to talk to a website, and gets an SSL Handshake exception in the logs. 

This was made for someting I was building where it would not link to a website, and so I rewrote some code online to make this work for android. 

This is highly insecure, but for development purposes it works with me. This should never be placed into thew final product of code.
